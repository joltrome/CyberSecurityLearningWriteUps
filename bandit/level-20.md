Bandit Level 20: Local Network Service Authentication
Challenge Description
The challenge involves a setuid binary in the home directory that:

Makes a connection to localhost on a specified port

Reads a line of text from the connection

Compares it to the password from the previous level (bandit20)

If correct, transmits the password for the next level (bandit21)

Solution
Step 1: Understanding the Challenge
The binary acts as a client that connects to a local service we need to create. We must:

Set up a simple server on localhost that sends the bandit20 password

Run the binary pointing to our server port

Receive the bandit21 password in response

Step 2: Exploring the Environment
First, I checked what files were available in the home directory:

bash
ls -la
Output:

text
total 36
drwxr-xr-x  2 root     root      4096 May  7 14:14 .
drwxr-xr-x 70 root     root      4096 May  7 14:14 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root       220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root      3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root       675 May 15  2017 .profile
-rwsr-xr-x  1 bandit21 bandit20 12088 May  7 14:14 suconnect
The suconnect binary is the setuid program we need to use.

Step 3: Understanding the Binary
I ran the binary without arguments to see its usage:

bash
./suconnect
Output:

text
Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP.
If it receives the correct password for the current level (bandit20),
it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
Step 4: Setting Up the Server
I needed to create a simple server that would send the bandit20 password. Using netcat (nc), I set up a listener on port 1234:

bash
echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 1234 -q 1
Command breakdown:

echo "password": Outputs the bandit20 password

|: Pipes the output to netcat

nc -l -p 1234: Netcat listens on port 1234

-q 1: Quits 1 second after EOF (end of file)

Step 5: Running the Client Binary
In another terminal session (or using background execution), I ran the suconnect binary:

bash
./suconnect 1234
Step 6: One-Liner Alternative
Alternatively, I used a single command that runs both processes:

bash
echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 1234 -q 1 & ./suconnect 1234
Output:

text
Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password

Key Learning Points
1. Network Client-Server Communication
Client-server model: Understanding how programs communicate over networks

Localhost services: Services running on the same machine can communicate via localhost

Port usage: Different services use different ports for communication

2. Netcat Utility
Network Swiss Army knife: Netcat is versatile for various network operations

Server mode: -l flag makes netcat listen for incoming connections

Port specification: -p flag specifies the port to listen on

Automatic termination: -q flag controls when netcat exits after connection closes

3. Process Management
Background execution: Using & to run processes in the background

Concurrent execution: Running multiple processes simultaneously

Input/output redirection: Piping output between commands

4. Setuid Binary Behavior
Privilege escalation: Setuid binaries run with owner's privileges

Security implications: Understanding why certain operations require elevated privileges

Controlled access: The binary validates input before providing sensitive information

5. Authentication Protocols
Challenge-response: The binary implements a simple authentication protocol

Password verification: Comparing received input against stored credentials

Conditional access: Only providing next credentials after successful authentication

Command Summary
bash
# Check available files
ls -la

# Understand binary usage
./suconnect

# Set up server with netcat
echo "bandit20_password" | nc -l -p [port] -q 1

# Run client (in separate terminal)
./suconnect [port]

# One-liner approach
echo "bandit20_password" | nc -l -p [port] -q 1 & ./suconnect [port]
Real-World Applications
This challenge demonstrates several important networking and security concepts:

Service authentication: Many real-world services use similar challenge-response mechanisms

Local service communication: Inter-process communication via network sockets

Network troubleshooting: Using simple tools like netcat to test network services

Privilege separation: Setuid programs providing controlled access to sensitive information

Automated credential handoff: Similar to how APIs or services exchange authentication tokens

The methodology used here is applicable to:

Testing network services during development

Debugging client-server applications

Understanding authentication mechanisms

Working with privileged operations in a controlled manner

This level reinforces the importance of understanding both client and server roles in network communications and how authentication can be implemented at the network level.
