# Bandit Level 32 â†’ 33 (Final Level) - Uppercase Shell Escape and Privilege Escalation

## Challenge Description
After all this `git` stuff, it's time for another escape. Good luck!

## Solution

### Step 1: Understanding the Uppercase Shell
Upon logging into bandit32, I was immediately greeted with an unusual shell:

```
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>>
```

**Initial testing revealed the core restriction:**
- Any command I typed was converted to uppercase
- Since Unix/Linux commands are case-sensitive, this broke normal command execution

**Example:**
```bash
>> :shell
sh: 1: :SHELL: Permission denied
>>
```

My `:shell` command became `:SHELL`, which doesn't exist as a command.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Problem
The uppercase shell presented a classic input sanitization bypass challenge:
- **Input filtering**: All user input converted to uppercase
- **Case sensitivity**: Unix commands require exact case matching
- **Escape requirement**: Need to execute commands without them being uppercased

### Step 3: The Key Insight - Shell Variable Expansion
I realized that shell variables might be processed differently than direct command input. The critical breakthrough was testing `$0`:

```bash
>> $0
```

**What `$0` represents:**
- `$0` is a special shell variable that contains the name/path of the current shell
- When the shell processes `$0`, it expands to the actual shell binary before the uppercase conversion
- This spawned a new shell process, bypassing the uppercase restriction

### Step 4: Successful Escape
After executing `$0`, I gained access to a normal shell prompt without uppercase restrictions:

```bash
$ whoami
bandit33
```

**Critical discovery:** I was now running as bandit33, not bandit32!

### Step 5: Understanding the Privilege Escalation
I investigated why I was running as bandit33:

```bash
$ ls -la /home/bandit32/uppershell
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit33 bandit32 8616 Aug 15 13:16 /home/bandit32/uppershell
```

**Key observations:**
- The `uppershell` binary has the **setuid bit** set (`-rwsr-x---`)
- It's owned by **bandit33** but executable by bandit32
- When I escaped to a new shell, it inherited bandit33's effective user ID

### Step 6: Analyzing the Binary
I used `strings` to examine the uppershell binary:

```bash
$ strings uppershell
```

**Important function calls identified:**
- `setreuid` - Changes real and effective user IDs
- `geteuid` - Gets effective user ID
- `system` - Executes shell commands
- `toupper` - Converts characters to uppercase

This confirmed that the binary was designed to run with elevated privileges and had the capability to change user context.

### Step 7: Reading the Final Password
With bandit33 privileges, I could access the final level's password:

```bash
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
```

**Success!** Retrieved the final message/password, completing the Bandit wargame.

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Input Sanitization Bypass
- **Incomplete filtering**: The uppercase conversion didn't account for shell variable expansion
- **Processing order**: Shell variables are expanded before command interpretation
- **Bypass techniques**: Using `$0`, `$SHELL`, or other shell variables to escape restrictions

### 2. Setuid Binary Exploitation
- **Privilege inheritance**: When setuid programs spawn shells, the shells inherit elevated privileges
- **Effective vs real UID**: Understanding how setuid programs manage different user contexts
- **Security implications**: Poorly designed setuid programs can lead to privilege escalation

### 3. Shell Variable Exploitation
- **`$0` variable**: Contains the current shell's name/path
- **Variable expansion**: Happens before input filtering in many cases
- **Context switching**: Using shell variables to spawn new processes with different contexts

### 4. Binary Analysis Techniques
- **`strings` command**: Extracting readable strings from binary files
- **Function identification**: Recognizing security-relevant function calls
- **Permission analysis**: Understanding file permissions and their security implications

### 5. Privilege Escalation Concepts
- **Horizontal escalation**: Moving between users of similar privilege levels
- **Vertical escalation**: Gaining higher system privileges
- **Trust boundaries**: Understanding when programs run with different privileges

## Command Summary
```bash
# Initial escape attempt (failed)
>> :shell

# Successful escape using shell variable
>> $0

# Privilege verification
$ whoami
$ id

# Binary analysis
$ ls -la /home/bandit32/uppershell
$ strings /home/bandit32/uppershell

# Final password retrieval
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
```

## Alternative Escape Methods

### Other Shell Variables:
```bash
>> $SHELL    # Might work if it contains the shell path
>> $1        # First argument (if any)
>> $$        # Process ID (less likely to work)
```

### Environment Variable Exploitation:
```bash
>> $HOME/../../bin/bash    # Path traversal via variables
>> $PWD/../../../bin/sh    # Alternative path construction
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Penetration Testing
- **Input validation bypass**: Testing applications that filter user input
- **Shell escape techniques**: Breaking out of restricted environments
- **Privilege escalation**: Exploiting setuid binaries for higher access
- **Binary analysis**: Examining executables for security vulnerabilities

### 2. Security Development
- **Secure coding**: Understanding how input sanitization can be bypassed
- **Setuid design**: Properly implementing privilege separation
- **Shell security**: Designing restricted shells that resist escape attempts
- **Variable handling**: Securely processing shell variables and environment

### 3. System Administration
- **Security auditing**: Identifying potentially exploitable setuid binaries
- **Access control**: Understanding privilege escalation vectors
- **Shell hardening**: Configuring secure shell environments
- **Binary permissions**: Properly managing file permissions and setuid bits

### 4. Incident Response
- **Attack analysis**: Understanding how attackers escape restricted environments
- **Privilege tracking**: Following privilege escalation chains
- **Binary forensics**: Analyzing suspicious executables
- **Shell logging**: Monitoring for escape attempts and privilege changes

## Security Implications

### 1. Input Sanitization Limitations
- **Incomplete filtering**: Converting case doesn't prevent all bypass techniques
- **Processing order matters**: Filter placement in the input processing chain is critical
- **Variable expansion risks**: Shell variables can bypass many input filters

### 2. Setuid Binary Risks
- **Privilege inheritance**: Child processes inherit elevated privileges
- **Shell spawning**: Any shell escape leads to full privilege escalation
- **Attack surface**: Every setuid binary is a potential privilege escalation vector

### 3. Defensive Measures
```bash
# Proper setuid binary design principles:
# 1. Drop privileges immediately after necessary operations
# 2. Validate all input thoroughly before processing
# 3. Avoid shell command execution when possible
# 4. Use execve() instead of system() for command execution
# 5. Implement proper logging and monitoring
```

## Conclusion

This final level demonstrates sophisticated privilege escalation through shell escape techniques. The challenge combines:

- **Input sanitization bypass** using shell variable expansion
- **Setuid binary exploitation** for privilege escalation
- **Binary analysis** to understand the attack vector
- **System-level understanding** of Unix privilege management

The solution showcases how seemingly simple input filtering (uppercase conversion) can be bypassed through understanding of shell internals, and how setuid binaries must be carefully designed to prevent privilege escalation.

**Congratulations on completing the OverTheWire Bandit wargame!** This journey covered fundamental cybersecurity concepts including file permissions, network services, cryptography, shell scripting, git security, and privilege escalation - all essential skills for cybersecurity professionals.

The progression from basic file operations to complex privilege escalation demonstrates the interconnected nature of system security and the importance of understanding how different components interact to create or prevent security vulnerabilities.
